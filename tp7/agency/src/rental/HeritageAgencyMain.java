/**
 * Creates a agency containing 3 Vehicles, 3 Cars and 3 Motorbikes, printing all vehicles with a price inferior to 175, then two client rent a car each. Then it creates a suspicious agency with the same vehicles, it prints again all vehicles with a price inferior to 175 then the clients rent the same vehicles and we see the differences between the two agencies.
